This is my first project from the The Odin Project—called Google Homepage. This is a simple homepage web design, but personally, it was tough and takes me a couple of days to finish. I was fun though! I kinda like it! I like the challenge.

In this challenge, I learned the following skills:
    Two ways to move a div around on the page,
    Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page,
    Identify the background color of an existing webpage,
    Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage,
    Center an element horizontally,
    Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page,
    Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page,
    Build a very basic form (even if it doesn’t “go” anywhere).
